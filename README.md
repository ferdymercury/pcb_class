# PCB Class

This is the location for the class materials for the
Surface Mount Technology Printed Circuit Board (SMT/PCB)
"mini-class" presented at Hacker Dojo during the summer
of 2013.

## Goal

The goal of the class is that each participant will design,
send out for manufacture, order parts, solder and test out
a surface mount technology printed circuit board by the
end of the class.

## Administration

The class is broken into a "lecture" followed by question
and answers (Q&A).  The goal will be to keep each "lecture"
approximately 15 minutes long.  Each Q&A session will be
as long as there are questions.  Both the "lecture" and
the Q&A will be video recorded and uploaded to YouTube
so that people who can not make a particular session can
catch up.

The class is free in the sense that anybody can attend.
The class is not free in the sense that if you build a PCB
you will have at least pay to get the PCB manufactured
and purchase all the required parts that are needed to
construct and test the board.  If the participant decides
to set up the ability to work on surface mount parts outside
of Hacker Dojo, there will be some significant expenses for
devices like soldering irons, microscopes, PCB shears, etc.

KiCAD is the presented PCB design tool.  If a participant
is more comfortable with an alternative like Eagle, that
is also quite acceptable.
